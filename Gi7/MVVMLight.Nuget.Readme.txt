***Windows 8 Metro style only***

Windows 8 has a new way to import CLR namespaces into XAML.

In order to avoid issues, after installing MVVM Light through Nuget in your Windows 8 Metro style application, follow these steps:

- open App.xaml

- Locate the statement
xmlns:vm="clr-namespace:[YouApplication].ViewModel"

- Replace this statement with:
xmlns:vm="using:[YouApplication].ViewModel"
